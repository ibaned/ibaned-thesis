\chapter{FULL IMPLEMENTATION}

This chapter ``puts it all together" to describe
exactly what happens when you adapt

\section{Mesh Adaptation}

\subsection{Inputs}

\subsection{Refinement}

\subsection{Coarsening}

\subsection{Shape Correction}

\section{Mesh Motion}

Describe ``outer loop" of mesh motion steps
combined with adaptivity.

\section{Anisotropic Adaptation}

There is a similar ``outer loop" used to
reliably adapt to highly anisotropic metrics.
