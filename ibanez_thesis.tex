% Use the first command below if you want captions over 1 line indented. A side
% effect of this is to remove the use of bold for captions (thesis default).
% To restore bold, also include the second line below.

\renewcommand{\captionfont}{\bfseries} % bold caption (needed with caption
                                       % package to restore boldface.)
%\includeonly{rpichap1}  % use \includeonly to process only
                         % the file(s) listed inside the braces
