itemizing specific features and citing references for them.

\subsection{Overview of Contributions}

Also indicates where in the thesis they are.

\section{Definitions}

\subsection{Nomenclature}

Probably a big table goes here, with explaining text.

\subsection{Conformal Meshes}

\section{Petascale and Heterogeneous Supercomputers}

\subsection{Programming Environments}

Latex requires at least one citation to
compile: \cite{edwards2013kokkos}.
